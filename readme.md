## ðŸ“š Glossary
- **angle of incidence**: The angle of incidence refers to the angle at which a ray of light strikes a surface, relative to the perpendicular (or normal) to that surface.
- **artifact**: An "artifact" refers to any unwanted or unintended visual anomaly in an image or rendering.
- **lambertian reflection**: Lambertian reflection refers to an idealized type of surface reflectance that is perfectly diffuse, meaning it reflects light equally in all directions, regardless of the angle of incidence.
- **self-intersection**: Self-intersection is an artifact that occurs when a ray intersects the same surface from which it has just been reflected or refracted. This issue, often resulting from numerical precision limitations, can lead to visual distortions such as speckling or improper shading on the surface.
