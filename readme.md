## Glossary
- **artifact**: An "artifact" refers to any unwanted or unintended visual anomaly in an image or rendering.
- **self-intersection**: Self-intersection is an artifact that occurs when a ray intersects the same surface from which it has just been reflected or refracted. This issue, often resulting from numerical precision limitations, can lead to visual distortions such as speckling or improper shading on the surface.
